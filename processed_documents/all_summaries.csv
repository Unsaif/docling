PAH,"Phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) deficiency, also known as phenylketonuria (PKU), is an autosomal recessive inborn error of metabolism caused by loss-of-function pathogenic variants in the PAH gene. Deficiency of PAH leads to elevated phenylalanine (Phe) concentrations, resulting in neurotoxicity and intellectual disability if untreated. Newborn screening enables early detection, allowing for dietary and pharmacological interventions to prevent severe neurologic sequelae. The clinical spectrum ranges from classic PKU to mild hyperphenylalaninemia, with phenotypic variability partly explained by genotype. Severe maternal hyperphenylalaninemia during pregnancy causes maternal PKU (MPKU) syndrome in offspring, including intellectual disability and congenital anomalies. Lifelong management requires dietary restriction, support from a multidisciplinary team, and careful surveillance. The worldwide incidence is approximately 1:23,930 newborns, with higher rates in some populations.","Untreated PAH deficiency manifests as severe and irreversible neurocognitive impairment (intellectual disability), microcephaly, epilepsy, neurologic symptoms (including movement disorders and seizures), neurobehavioral/psychiatric problems, decreased skin and hair pigmentation, eczema, and a musty body odor. In women with PAH deficiency who are inadequately treated during pregnancy, maternal PKU syndrome can occur in offspring, presenting with intellectual disability (>90%), microcephaly, poor neurobehavioral outcomes (including ADHD and anxiety/depression), congenital heart defects, intrauterine growth restriction, and other birth defects such as cleft palate, spina bifida, and diaphragmatic hernia.","When treated from birth, most individuals develop normally, but mild reductions in intellectual functioning, executive skills, attention, and fine motor skills may remain. There is an increased rate of anxiety and depression and possible mild neurologic issues (hypertonia, movement disorders, seizures), which typically improve or resolve with good blood Phe control. Bone mineral density may be reduced but not to the level of osteoporosis. Vitamin B12 deficiency can occur if diet is not appropriately supplemented. Regular surveillance helps detect and manage long-term or subtle neuropsychological or nutritional issues.","PAH deficiency spans a spectrum:
- Classic PKU: Severe, with untreated plasma Phe >1,000 µmol/L; nearly complete loss of PAH activity; profound neurotoxicity if untreated.
- Mild PKU and variant PKU: Intermediate Phe levels (360–1,000 µmol/L), partial enzyme activity; milder cognitive/neurological issues without treatment.
- Non-PKU hyperphenylalaninemia: Phe >120 but <360 µmol/L; typically does not require treatment but monitored.
Genotype-phenotype correlation is imperfect, though certain variants (biallelic null alleles) predict non-responsiveness to BH4 (sapropterin). Responsiveness to sapropterin is higher in mild/moderate forms. Maternal PKU syndrome is a distinct variant occurring in offspring of pregnant women with uncontrolled PAH deficiency.","PAH deficiency results from loss-of-function biallelic variants in the PAH gene (autosomal recessive). To date, over 1,000 pathogenic or likely pathogenic mutations have been identified and validated, including missense, nonsense, splice-site variants, small deletions/insertions, and rare exonic deletions/duplications. Approximately 95%-99% of pathogenic variants can be detected by sequence analysis and 2%-3% by gene-targeted deletion/duplication analysis (e.g., MLPA). Carriers are asymptomatic.","Global incidence is about 1:23,930 live births. Incidence varies by region: as high as 1:850 in the Karachay-Cherkess region of Russia; 1:4,000–1:10,000 in Europe/Middle East; 1:25,000 in the US; lower in Asia (e.g., 1:125,000 in Japan).","Diagnosis in newborns is via newborn screening using dried blood spots (24–72 hrs after birth), measuring elevated phenylalanine and the phenylalanine-to-tyrosine (Phe:Tyr) ratio by tandem mass spectrometry. Follow-up biochemical testing confirms persistent hyperphenylalaninemia (Phe >120 µmol/L, Phe:Tyr ≥3). Exclusion of tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) defects is recommended via pterin/DHPR assays or multigene panels. Definitive diagnosis is by molecular genetic testing showing biallelic pathogenic PAH variants.","Differential diagnoses include other causes of hyperphenylalaninemia: disorders of tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) synthesis or recycling (e.g., AR-GTPCH deficiency/GCH1, PTPS deficiency/PTS, DHRP deficiency/QDPR, PCD deficiency/PCBD1) and DNAJC12 deficiency. These typically present with additional neurologic signs and require distinct treatment (e.g., BH4 or neurotransmitter precursors).","Lifelong, age-appropriate phenylalanine-restricted diet supplemented with Phe-free medical foods (amino acid or glycomacropeptide-based). Sapropterin dihydrochloride (synthetic BH4 cofactor) may be added for responsive individuals. Enzyme substitution therapy with pegvaliase (pegylated recombinant phenylalanine ammonia lyase) is approved for adults with poor control on dietary therapy. Large neutral amino acids (LNAA) are an adjunct for adolescents/adults but contraindicated in pregnancy. Special management is needed preconception and during pregnancy to prevent maternal PKU syndrome (strict Phe control <360 µmol/L). Avoid aspartame-containing products. Treatment is coordinated by a multidisciplinary metabolic team.","With early diagnosis and strict, lifelong treatment, affected individuals generally have normal cognitive development and quality of life, with only mild neuropsychological or neurologic issues in some. Educational, social, and occupational outcomes are favorable. Untreated or late-diagnosed cases have irreversible intellectual disability and neurologic damage. Children of women with untreated PAH deficiency are at high risk for teratogenic effects. Prognosis strongly correlates with treatment adherence and early intervention."
TP63,"TP63-related disorders are a group of autosomal dominant syndromes involving developmental anomalies affecting ectodermal structures, limbs, face, and orofacial region. The main overlapping clinical entities are: ankyloblepharon-ectodermal defects-cleft lip/palate (AEC) syndrome, ectrodactyly-ectodermal dysplasia-cleft lip/palate syndrome 3 (EEC3), acro-dermo-ungual-lacrimal-tooth (ADULT) syndrome, limb-mammary syndrome, split-hand/foot malformation type 4 (SHFM4), and isolated cleft lip/palate (Orofacial cleft 8). Common features include ectodermal dysplasia (hair, nails, teeth, skin), cleft lip/palate, limb anomalies and lacrimal duct obstruction. Clinical presentation and severity vary between and within syndromes. Management is multidisciplinary and symptomatic, including surgical, dermatologic, dental, ophthalmologic, and psychological interventions. Pathogenic variants are most often missense changes affecting protein domains of p63, a master regulator of epithelial and limb development.","If untreated, affected individuals may have chronic skin erosions (risk of secondary infection, dehydration, malnutrition), significant dental anomalies (hypodontia), conductive hearing loss, persistent clefts of lip and/or palate leading to feeding and speech problems, split-hand/foot malformations affecting function, persistent lacrimal obstruction leading to chronic conjunctivitis, and potential psychosocial adversity. Severe forms (notably AEC syndrome) may have life-threatening skin erosions and infections in infancy. Growth retardation and failure to thrive can occur in early childhood. Developmental delay is possible due to medical complications and hearing loss.","With early multidisciplinary intervention, many complications are manageable. Skin erosions can be minimized and infection risk reduced through wound care and infection control; specialized dental and prosthodontic care can address hypodontia; hearing loss can be improved with myringotomy and amplification; surgical repair of clefts and correction of limb anomalies help optimize function. Psychosocial support ameliorates quality of life. Growth and nutritional status usually improve with intervention. Regular monitoring of dental and hearing status is important.","The major variants are: AEC syndrome (includes Rapp-Hodgkin syndrome; prominent skin erosions, ankyloblepharon), EEC3 (split-hand/foot malformation, ectodermal dysplasia, clefting), ADULT syndrome (acro-dermo-ungual-lacrimal-tooth; mild ectodermal, freckling, breast/nipple hypoplasia), limb-mammary syndrome (limb anomalies and mammary/nipple hypoplasia, minor ectodermal features), SHFM4 (mainly split-hand/foot malformation, little/no ectodermal or clefting), and isolated Orofacial cleft 8 (minimal features besides cleft). Clinical severity, affecting skin, teeth, hair, limbs, and clefts, as well as penetrance, ranges by variant. ADULT and limb-mammary show breast/nipple involvement; AEC is distinguished by severe erosions; SHFM4 lacks ectodermal and clefting features.","TP63-related disorders are caused by heterozygous pathogenic variants in TP63, primarily missense variants, but also deletions, nonsense, and splice site mutations. Pathogenic effects are mostly dominant-negative or (in ADULT syndrome) gain-of-function. Over 100 unique pathogenic mutations have been identified and validated. Genotype-phenotype correlation is observed: AEC typically involves SAM domain or N-terminal truncations, EEC3 by DNA-binding domain missense mutations, ADULT by DNA-binding domain changes, limb-mammary by mutations between TA and DNA domains, and SHFM4 by TA or DNA domain variants.","Exact incidence is unknown, but TP63-related disorders are rare. Combined, they likely account for fewer than 1 in several hundred thousand live births. Prevalence by country/ethnic group is not established due to rarity; de novo mutations are frequent (about 70% of cases), while ~30% are inherited.","Diagnosis in newborns is suspected in those with clefts, skin erosions, limb malformations, ectodermal dysplasia, together with suggestive family history. Genetic confirmation is by sequencing of TP63 (sequence analysis identifies ~99% of cases). Gene-targeted deletion/duplication analysis detects rare copy number changes. High-throughput panels or genomic sequencing can be used if the phenotype is non-specific. TP63 is not part of standard metabolic newborn screening; recognition is clinical with rapid molecular confirmation.","Differential diagnoses include: epidermolysis bullosa simplex (EBS: EXPH5, KRT5, KRT14, TGM5), autosomal recessive congenital ichthyosis (ABCA12, etc., with collodion membrane), Curly hair-ankyloblepharon-nail dysplasia syndrome (RIPK4), cocoon syndrome (CHUK), SHFM1 (DLX5), SHFM3 (10q24 duplication), SHFM6 (WNT10B), and hypohidrotic ectodermal dysplasia (HED; EDA, EDAR, EDARADD, WNT10A). Distinction is based on clinical features (pattern of ectodermal/limb involvement, presence of clefts, hair/nail/skin findings, lack/severity of hypohidrosis, genetic testing).",Treatment is multidisciplinary and tailored to manifestations: gentle wound care and bleach soaks for skin erosions; antibiotics for infections; hydration/nutritional support for infants; wigs for alopecia; dental prosthesis or implants for hypodontia; surgical repair for cleft lip/palate; ophthalmologic interventions for lacrimal duct atresia/obstruction; myringotomy for chronic otitis with hearing loss; occupational/physical therapy and surgery for limb malformations; plastic surgery for breast/nipple asymmetry; developmental assessment and psychosocial/psychological support as needed. Regular surveillance for dental and hearing needs.,"Prognosis is good if identified and treated early. Morbidity is minimized and life expectancy is normal with appropriate multidisciplinary care. Most children achieve good functional outcomes and quality of life, though some features (e.g., dental or limb anomalies) are lifelong and may require repeated interventions. Delay in treatment, particularly for skin erosions, feeding/nutrition, or hearing loss, can result in increased risk of infection, malnutrition, developmental delays, or psychosocial difficulties."
