      "## Summary\n",
      "\n",
      "## Clinical characteristics\n",
      "\n",
      "The phenotypes in individuals with PAH deficiency include PAH deficiency treated from birth and latediagnosed or untreated PAH deficiency. Maternal PKU (MPKU) syndrome occurs in offspring of mothers with inadequately treated PAH deficiency during pregnancy and results from the toxic effects of elevated blood phenylalanine (Phe) concentrations on the developing fetus.\n",
      "\n",
      "PAH deficiency treated from birth is characterized by the following, even with adherence to a low Phe diet: (1) a modest but measurable decrease in intellectual functioning as well variable impairments in executive function, attention, and fine motor functions; (2) an increased prevalence of mental health concerns including anxiety and depression; and (3) neurologic problems (including hypertonia, paraplegia, movement disorders, and seizures), which may improve or resolve with lowering blood Phe concentration.\n",
      "\n",
      "Late-diagnosed or untreated PAH deficiency is characterized by irreversible neurocognitive impairment (intellectual disability), neurobehavioral/psychological issues, neurologic manifestations (motor disturbances including movement disorders and seizures), and microcephaly. Although lowering blood Phe concentration sometimes improves neurobehavioral/psychological issues and motor disturbances, it does not reduce neurocognitive impairment.\n",
      "\n",
      "MPKU syndrome is characterized by intellectual disability, neurobehavioral/psychiatric manifestations, congenital heart defects, and other birth defects.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Diagnosis/testing\n",
      "\n",
      "The diagnosis of PAH deficiency is established in all neonates following an out-of-range newborn screening result with (1) biochemical testing (plasma amino acid analysis) and (2) molecular genetic testing to identify the causative biallelic PAH pathogenic variants to confirm the biochemical diagnosis of PAH deficiency and inform clinical management and genetic counseling.\n",

      "\n",
      "## Management\n",
      "\n",
      "Targeted therapies: Lifelong treatment of all individuals with an untreated blood Phe concentration greater than 360 μmol/L with an age-appropriate Phe-restricted diet and Phe-free protein supplementation with medical foods (amino acid or glycomacropeptide based). In certain individuals, FDA-approved pharmacologic therapies may include the Phe hydroxylase activator/cofactor sapropterin dihydrochloride and/or enzyme substitution therapy (pegvaliase).\n",
      "\n",
      "Supportive care: Because treatment for affected individuals of all ages can be difficult, the support of an experienced health care team consisting of physicians, metabolic dietitians, genetic counselors, social workers, nurses, nurse practitioners, and psychologists is essential for all individuals with PAH deficiency and their parents/caregivers. Teaching should include information on malnutrition and growth failure, the side effects of dietary treatment. Therapy needs are greater for individuals with late diagnosis and resultant neurodevelopmental deficits. As PAH deficiency is a lifelong disorder with varying age-related implications, smooth transition of care of affected individuals from a pediatric setting is essential for long-term management and should be organized as a well-planned, continuous, multidisciplinary process integrating resources of all relevant subspecialties.\n",
      "\n",
      "Surveillance: Regular individualized screening for early identification of the manifestations of PAH deficiency treated from birth and late-diagnosed or untreated PAH deficiency is required.\n",
      "\n",
      "Agents/circumstances to avoid: Aspartame, an artificial sweetener often added to soft drinks, foods, and some medications, is metabolized in the gastrointestinal tract into Phe and aspartate. Persons with PAH deficiency should either (1) avoid products containing aspartame or (2) when using such products calculate total Phe intake in order to adapt diet components accordingly.\n",
      "\n",
      "Evaluation of relatives at risk: If the PAH pathogenic variants in the family are known, molecular genetic prenatal testing of a fetus at risk can be performed via amniocentesis or chorionic villus sampling to allow for treatment at birth of an infant known to be affected. Any at-risk newborn sib who did not have prenatal testing should be evaluated immediately after birth for PAH deficiency by measuring blood Phe concentration to allow for earliest possible diagnosis and treatment. Older at-risk sibs - even those who are apparently asymptomatic - should be evaluated for PAH deficiency given the significant variability in the clinical manifestations of previously undiagnosed PAH deficiency.\n",
      "\n",
      "Preconception, pregnancy, and postpartum care: Preconception: achieve and maintain maternal blood Phe concentration at &lt;360 µmol/L for three months prior to conception; provide genetic counseling regarding the teratogenic effects of elevated maternal blood Phe concentration on the developing fetus. Pregnancy: maintain maternal blood Phe concentration at 120-360 µmol/L during pregnancy and monitor dietary intake to ensure that dietary nutrients are adequate. Postpartum: monitor blood Phe concentrations of mother and infant as needed.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Genetic counseling\n",
      "\n",
      "PAH deficiency is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. If both parents are known to be heterozygous for a PAH pathogenic variant, each sib of an affected individual has at conception a 25% chance of being affected, a 50% chance of being an asymptomatic carrier, and a 25% chance of inheriting neither of the familial PAH pathogenic variants. Children born of one parent with PAH deficiency and one parent with two normal PAH alleles are obligate heterozygotes. If the mother is the affected parent, MPKU syndrome is a critical issue. Females with PAH deficiency should receive counseling regarding the teratogenic effects of elevated maternal plasma Phe concentration (i.e., MPKU syndrome) when they reach childbearing age. Once the PAH pathogenic variants have been identified in an affected family member, carrier testing for at-risk relatives and prenatal/ preimplantation genetic testing for PAH deficiency are possible.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Diagnosis\n",
      "\n",
      "Recently published recommendations from the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG) for the diagnosis and management of phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) deficiency [Smith et al 2025] supplement the published ACMG guidelines [Vockley et al 2014].\n",
      "\n",
      "## Suggestive Findings\n",
      "\n",
      "A diagnosis of PAH deficiency should be suspected due to an out-of-range newborn screening (NBS) result prior to onset of suggestive findings (see Scenario 1) or manifestations of PAH deficiency (see Scenario 2).\n",
      "\n",
      "## Scenario 1: Out-of-Range Newborn Screening (NBS) Result\n",
      "\n",
      "NBS for PAH deficiency is primarily based on use of dried blood spots collected between 24 and 72 hours after birth to quantify phenylalanine (Phe) and tyrosine (Tyr) concentrations by tandem mass spectrometry (MS/ MS). For information on NBS by state in the United States (US), see www.newbornscreening.hrsa.gov/yourstate.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the US most NBS laboratories determine their own cutoff levels for out-of-range test results; thus, newborns with an NBS result with elevated Phe concentrations must undergo additional testing as soon as possible to determine its etiology (see Establishing the Diagnosis, Biochemical Testing and Molecular Genetic Testing).\n",
      "\n",
      "For recommendations on presumptive treatment while awaiting diagnostic confirmation, consult a metabolic specialist to discuss immediate care needs. If a metabolic specialist is not available, the following treatment should be considered (see Management):\n",
      "\n",
      "- · Verify the abnormal result with the state screening laboratory.\n",
      "- · Consult the ACMG ACT sheet.\n",
      "- · Ascertain that the infant is clinically well.\n",
      "- · Obtain follow-up plasma or serum amino acid analysis and urine/blood pterin analysis.\n",
      "\n",
      "Note: Do not initiate dietary Phe restriction before confirmatory testing is sent.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Scenario 2: Symptomatic Individual\n",
      "\n",
      "A symptomatic individual can have either (1) typical findings associated with late-diagnosed PAH deficiency or (2) untreated infantile-onset PAH deficiency resulting from any of the following: NBS not performed, false negative NBS result, clinical findings prior to receiving NBS result, or caregivers not adherent to recommended treatment after a positive NBS result. PAH deficiency should be considered in probands with the following clinical, laboratory, and imaging findings and family history.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Clinical findings (infancy to adulthood)\n",
      "\n",
      "- · Epilepsy\n",
      "- · Neurologic findings including movement disorders, sensory manifestations, tremors, and Parkinson-like features (particularly in adults)\n",
      "- · Any level of irreversible intellectual disability and neurobehavioral/psychiatric manifestations including emotional and social problems and autistic features\n",
      "- · Musty body odor\n",
      "- · Decreased skin and hair pigmentation\n",
      "- · Eczema\n",
      "\n",
      "Supportive biochemical findings could include (if obtained) those in Establishing the Diagnosis, Biochemical Testing.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Brain imaging findings\n",
      "\n",
      "- · White matter abnormalities, particularly parietal and frontal with some temporal involvement (involving mostly periventricular and central white matter)\n",
      "- · Restricted diffusion\n",
      "- · Occasional cerebral or cerebellar atrophy [Bako &amp; Çıkı 2023]\n",
      "\n",
      "Family history is consistent with autosomal recessive inheritance (e.g., affected sibs and/or parental consanguinity). Absence of a known family history does not preclude the diagnosis.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Establishing the Diagnosis\n",
      "\n",
      "The diagnosis of PAH deficiency is established in all neonates following an out-of-range NBS result with (1) biochemical testing (plasma amino acid analysis) and (2) molecular genetic testing [Smith et al 2025]. Molecular genetic testing is strongly recommended to confirm the biochemical diagnosis of PAH deficiency, inform clinical management, and allow genetic counseling.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Biochemical Testing\n",
      "\n",
      "The biochemical diagnosis of PAH deficiency is established in a proband with the following [Vockley et al 2104, Smith et al 2025]:\n",
      "\n",
      "- · Blood phenylalanine concentrations &gt;120 umol/L\n",
      "- ⚬ Blood phenylalanine concentrations &gt;360 umol/L require treatment in some form for life (see Management, Treatment of Manifestations).\n",
      "- ⚬ Blood phenylalanine concentrations &gt;120 umol/L but &lt;360 umol/L require regular monitoring for at least the first two years of life as dietary protein intake increases, followed by monitoring every one or two years as indicated (see Management, Evaluations Following Initial Diagnosis, Individuals with benign hyperphenylalaninemia ).\n",
      "\n",
      "Note: Because blood Phe concentrations rise in the days after delivery, these recommendations are based on follow-up blood testing obtained after the NBS result.\n",
      "\n",
      "- · Phenylalanine-to-tyrosine (Phe:Tyr) ratio ≥3\n",
      "- · Absence of defects in biopterin synthesis or recycling* based on quantitative assay of pterins. Note: Because these assays are best performed in specialized centers and are not readily available in many countries, follow up of abnormal NBS result with molecular genetic testing is increasingly common.\n",
      "- ⚬ Quantitative assay of pterins (neopterin and biopterins) in urine or blood. If abnormal, reflex to quantitative assay of erythrocyte dihydropterine reductase (DHPR) activity if available (typically on dried blood spot). Reference values are available for different age groups.\n",
      "- ⚬ Abnormal pterin concentrations in urine or reduced red blood cell DHPR activity (from dried blood spots) should prompt enzyme testing for possible deficiencies of the following enzymes: GTP cyclohydrolase (AR-GTPCH), 6-pyruvoyl-tetrahydropterin synthase (PTPS), DHPR, or pterin carbinolamine-4α-dehydratase (PCD).\n",
      "- * Smith et al [2025] and van Spronsen et al [2021] emphasize that all neonates with persistent hyperphenylalaninemia must be screened for the tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) deficiencies via biochemical testing or a multigene panel to identify pathogenic variants in genes known to cause hyperphenylalaninemia (see Differential Diagnosis).\n",
      "\n",
      "## Molecular Genetic Testing\n",
      "\n",
      "The molecular diagnosis of PAH deficiency is established in a proband with biallelic PAH pathogenic (or likely pathogenic) variants identified by molecular genetic testing (see Table 1). Molecular analysis of PAH variants is not required to initiate (and should not delay) treatment; however, genotype can provide clinical information including prediction of severity and potential biopterin response as well as assisting with genetic counseling.\n",
      "\n",
      "Note: (1) Per ACMG/AMP variant interpretation guidelines, the terms \"pathogenic variant\" and \"likely pathogenic variant\" are synonymous in a clinical setting, meaning that both are considered diagnostic and can be used for clinical decision making [Richards et al 2015]. Reference to \"pathogenic variants\" in this GeneReview is understood to include likely pathogenic variants. (2) Identification of biallelic PAH variants of uncertain significance (or of one known PAH pathogenic variant and one PAH variant of uncertain significance) does not establish or rule out the diagnosis.\n",
      "\n",
      "Molecular genetic testing approaches can include single-gene testing, use of a multigene panel, or comprehensive genomic testing.\n",
      "\n",
      "- · Single-gene testing can be considered in probands with a biochemical diagnosis of PAH deficiency. Sequence analysis of PAH is performed first to detect missense, nonsense, and splice site variants and small intragenic deletions/insertions. Note: Depending on the sequencing method used, single-exon, multiexon, or whole-gene deletions/duplications might not be detected. If only one or no PAH variant is detected by the sequencing method used, the next step is to perform gene-targeted deletion/duplication analysis to detect exon and whole-gene deletions or duplications.\n",
      "- · Amultigene panel that includes PAH and other genes associated with hyperphenylalaninemia (see Differential Diagnosis) is most likely to identify the genetic cause of hyperphenylalaninemia while limiting identification of variants of uncertain significance and pathogenic variants in genes that do not explain the underlying phenotype. Note: (1) The genes included in the panel and the diagnostic sensitivity of the testing used for each gene vary by laboratory and are likely to change over time. (2) Some multigene panels might include genes not associated with the condition discussed in this GeneReview . (3) In some laboratories, panel options might include a custom laboratory-designed panel and/or custom phenotypefocused exome analysis that includes genes specified by the clinician. (4) Methods used in a panel might include sequence analysis, deletion/duplication analysis, and/or other non-sequencing-based tests.\n",
      "- For an introduction to multigene panels click here. More detailed information for clinicians ordering genetic tests can be found here.\n",
      "- · Comprehensive genomic testing, which does not require the clinician to determine which gene is likely involved, can be considered in a symptomatic individual who is not known to have PAH deficiency because the phenotype of untreated PAH deficiency is indistinguishable from many other inherited disorders characterized by epilepsy, intellectual disability, and neurologic findings characterized by movement disorders. Exome sequencing is most commonly used; genome sequencing is also possible. To date, most PAH pathogenic variants reported (e.g., missense, nonsense) are within the coding region and are likely to be identified on exome sequencing. However, because the spectrum of PAH variants is great, noncoding variants should be considered if biochemical testing is positive and no or only one PAH pathogenic variant has been found.\n",

      "## Clinical Characteristics\n",
      "\n",
      "## Clinical Description\n",
      "\n",
      "The phenotypes in individuals with phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) deficiency include PAH deficiency treated from birth and late-diagnosed or untreated PAH deficiency. In addition, maternal PKU (MPKU) syndrome is important to consider in offspring of mothers with inadequately treated PAH deficiency during pregnancy, as elevated blood phenylalanine (Phe) concentrations are toxic to the developing fetus [Smith et al 2025].\n",
      "\n",
      "## PAH Deficiency Treated from Birth\n",
      "\n",
      "Intelligence. Even with adherence to a low Phe diet, there is a modest but measurable decrease in intellectual functioning as well variable impairments in executive function, attention, and fine motor functions [Christ et al 2020, Adams et al 2023, Pardo et al 2024]. The correlation between early elevated blood Phe concentrations and long-term decreases in IQ has been well studied. A review of 55 studies from 1991 to 2021 and a meta-analysis of 14 studies noted significantly higher IQs in individuals who maintained blood Phe concentrations &lt;360 umol/L throughout life [Adams et al 2023].\n",
      "\n",
      "Neuropsychological issues. In individuals with early-treated PKU, certain psychological problems are increased as compared to control groups, unaffected sibs, or individuals with other chronic diseases [Brumm et al 2010, Bilder et al 2013, Adams et al 2023]. Individuals with early-treated PKU perform more poorly on tests of executive function, processing speed, and motor speed; there is a strong correlation of these findings with blood Phe concentrations [Christ et al 2023, Clocksin et al 2023].\n",
      "\n",
      "Individuals with early-treated PKU also have an increased prevalence of mental health concerns, including anxiety and depression [Jahja et al 2016, Manti et al 2016, Waisbren et al 2017, Trefz et al 2019].\n",
      "\n",
      "Evidence is emerging that lowering blood Phe concentrations in adults who have had persistently elevated blood Phe concentrations can improve both neuropsychological function [Burgess et al 2021, Bilder et al 2022, Manti et al 2023, Thomas et al 2023] and the related MRI changes [Clocksin et al 2021, Rocha et al 2023, Rovelli &amp; Longo 2023, Pardo et al 2024].\n",
      "\n",
      "Neurologic abnormalities associated with elevated blood Phe concentrations include increased deep tendon reflexes, ankle and patellar clonus, tremor, hypertonia, paraplegia or hemiplegia, progressive supranuclear palsy, choreiform or athetoid hyperkinesia, and seizures. Lowering blood Phe concentration often improves or resolves these neurologic manifestations [Jaulent et al 2020, Merkel et al 2023, Rovelli &amp; Longo 2023].\n",
      "\n",
      "Osteopenia. Numerous studies have indicated that individuals with PAH deficiency have bone mineral density that is below average or osteopenic, but not to a level of frank osteoporosis (as measured by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry scan) [Walter 2011, Demirdas et al 2015, Demirdas et al 2017, Lubout et al 2020, Daly et al 2021, Christ et al 2024].\n",
      "\n",
      "Vitamin B 12  deficiency can occur in individuals with complete or near-complete deficiency of PAH activity, particularly when they relax their Phe-restricted diet in adolescence [Robinson et al 2000, Walter 2011, Akı/uni015F et al 2020]. Vitamin B 12  is found in natural animal protein; affected individuals who decrease their amino acid supplementation provided by their medical food (formula) and still choose low-protein foods are at risk for vitamin B 12  deficiency [Kose &amp; Arslan 2019].\n",

      "Persistent severe hyperphenylalaninemia is characterized by irreversible neurocognitive impairment (intellectual disability), neurobehavioral/psychological issues, neurologic manifestations (motor disturbances including movement disorders and seizures), and microcephaly.

      "\n",
      "## MPKU Syndrome\n",
      "\n",
      "Elevated blood Phe concentrations are teratogenic during pregnancy. MPKU syndrome results from exposure of a fetus of a woman who has PAH deficiency to blood Phe concentrations &gt;360umol/L due either to poorly treated or untreated PAH deficiency during pregnancy. Rarely, a woman can be unaware of her diagnosis of PAH deficiency and, thus, bear children with MPKU syndrome [Alghamdi et al 2023].\n",

      "## · Microcephaly\n",
      "\n",
      "- · Poor neurobehavioral/psychiatric outcomes. Reports include increased prevalence of attention-deficit/ hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) (22% of individuals with MPKU syndrome were on ADHD medication) and anxiety and/or depression in 34% of individuals with MPKU syndrome.\n",
      "- ⚬ Risk of microcephaly is 5%-18% when maternal blood Phe concentration is optimized prior to ten weeks' gestation.\n",
      "- ⚬ Risk of microcephaly is &gt;90% if appropriate maternal blood Phe concentrations are never achieved during the pregnancy.\n",
      "- ⚬ Risk of microcephaly is 67% if appropriate maternal blood Phe concentrations are not achieved by 30 weeks' gestation.\n",
      "\n",
      "- · Congenital heart defects. Consistently elevated maternal blood Phe concentrations (&gt;600 µmol/L) during early gestation result in an 8%-12% risk of cardiac malformations [Levy et al 2001, Lupo et al 2024]. A recent review of the Texas birth defects registry noted the highest odds ratios associated with elevated phenylalanine-to-tyrosine (Phe:Tyr) ratios and transposition of the great vessels, atrioventricular septal defects, coarctation of the aorta, tetralogy of Fallot, hypoplastic left heart, and pulmonary valve stenosis/ atresia [Lupo et al 2024].\n",
      "- · Intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR). The frequency of IUGR does not differ from that in the general population when maternal blood Phe concentrations are controlled by 10 weeks' gestation; however, the risk of IUGR increases when maternal blood Phe concentration is not optimized until later in the pregnancy or if maternal blood Phe concentration is too low [Teissier et al 2012].\n",
      "- · Other birth defects reported with increased frequency associated with elevated Phe:Tyr ratios include tracheoesophageal fistula / esophageal atresia, gastroschisis, large or small intestinal atresia, spina bifida, diaphragmatic hernia, and cleft lip with or without cleft palate [Prick et al 2012, Lupo et al 2024].\n",

      "## Genotype-Phenotype Correlations\n",
      "\n",
      "Although genotype can be predictive of sapropterin dihydrochloride responsiveness (see Management, Targeted Therapies), genotype-phenotype correlations to date are imperfect; thus, all individuals with PAH deficiency except those with biallelic null PAH pathogenic variants should be offered a trial of sapropterin dihydrochloride therapy to assess responsiveness [Adams et al 2023]. Muntau et al [2019] reviewed 23 studies of sapropterin trials and noted a high level of sapropterin responsiveness in individuals classified as having mild or moderate PAH deficiency, and low levels of responsiveness in individuals with classic PAH deficiency.\n",

      "\n",
      "Hillert et al [2020] estimated the incidence of PAH deficiency worldwide at 1:23,930 newborns. The highest incidence is described in the Karachay-Cherkess region of Russia (1:850), with relatively higher incidences in Europe and some Middle Eastern countries (approximately 1:4,000 to 1:10,000). Incidence is somewhat lower in Asia outside of China (1:125,000 in Japan). Incidence in the United States is estimated at 1:25,000.\n",

      "\n",
      "Tetrahydrobiopterin (BH 4 ) deficiency. Hyperphenylalaninemia (HPA) can result from the impaired synthesis or recycling of tetrahydrobiopterin (BH 4 ), the cofactor in the phenylalanine, tyrosine, and tryptophan hydroxylation reactions. The HPAs caused by BH 4  deficiency (see Table 2) account for approximately 2% of individuals with elevated blood Phe concentrations in most populations. However, for persons with an elevated blood Phe concentration from populations in which phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) deficiency is less common (e.g., Japanese individuals), the risk to the affected individual of having a disorder of pterin metabolism is much higher. Note that Phe concentrations can be normal in some individuals with BH 4  deficiency.\n",
      "\n",
      "In principle, BH 4  deficiencies are treatable. Treatment requires the normalization of BH 4  availability and blood Phe concentration and restoration of the BH 4 -dependent hydroxylation of tyrosine and tryptophan. This is achieved by BH 4  supplementation along with dietary modification, neurotransmitter precursor replacement therapy, and supplements of folinic acid in dihydropterine reductase (DHPR) deficiency. However, residual neurologic manifestations such as movement abnormalities can persist. The treatment should be initiated early and probably continued for life [Blau et al 2011, Opladen et al 2020].\n",

The main consequences of PAH deficiency are: (1) accumulation of alternative products of Phe metabolism, including phenylacetic, phenylpyruvic, and phenyllactic acid, which are toxic to brain development; and (2) reduction of Tyr, resulting in deficiency of the neurotransmitters dopamine, adrenaline, and norepinephrine, which affects the conversion to thyroxine in the thyroid gland and melanin in melanocytes.\n",

         "PAH",
         "Phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) deficiency is an autosomal recessive metabolic disorder caused by biallelic mutations in the PAH gene, leading to impaired conversion of phenylalanine (Phe) to tyrosine. This results in elevated Phe concentrations and toxic brain effects ranging from mild to severe intellectual disability if untreated. The spectrum includes classic phenylketonuria (PKU), less severe variants, and benign hyperphenylalaninemia. Prompt newborn screening allows early dietary and/or pharmacologic intervention, which prevents severe outcomes. PAH deficiency is among the most common inborn errors of metabolism, detected in newborns worldwide, and requires lifelong management. Untreated pregnancies in affected women can result in maternal PKU syndrome, threatening fetal development.",
         "Untreated PAH deficiency leads to persistent severe hyperphenylalaninemia with irreversible neurocognitive impairment (intellectual disability), neurobehavioral and psychiatric issues, neurologic manifestations (such as movement disorders, hypertonia, seizures), microcephaly, decreased skin and hair pigmentation, eczema, and a musty body odor. Late-diagnosed individuals may have epileptic seizures, movement disorders, autistic features, and white matter brain abnormalities. Children exposed in utero to high maternal Phe (maternal PKU syndrome) frequently display intellectual disability, microcephaly, congenital heart defects, growth restriction, poor neuropsychiatric outcomes, and other structural malformations.",
         "Early and lifelong treatment, primarily with a Phe-restricted diet (plus medical food and, in some, sapropterin or pegvaliase), prevents most severe manifestations. Still, treated individuals may have a modest reduction in IQ, specific deficits in executive function, attention, and fine motor skills, and increased risks of psychiatric issues such as anxiety or depression. Neurologic symptoms (e.g., hypertonia, tremor, or seizures) may improve or resolve with controlled Phe levels. Bone mineral density is often below average (osteopenia). Vitamin B12 deficiency can develop if dietary adherence lapses.",
         "Variants include classic PKU (untreated plasma Phe >1000 μmol/L, severe enzyme deficiency), variant PKU (intermediate, Phe >360 but <1000 μmol/L), and non-PKU hyperphenylalaninemia (untreated Phe 120–360 μmol/L, milder forms). Mild hyperphenylalaninemia is 360-600 μmol/L. Clinical severity and risk of neurotoxicity correlate with the degree of PAH functional loss; classic PKU presents earliest and most severely, whereas milder forms may require only monitoring. Genotype correlates imperfectly with phenotype but relates to sapropterin responsiveness: milder variants are more likely to respond. Distinct from PAH deficiency are BH4 deficiencies and DNAJC12 deficiency, which cause hyperphenylalaninemia via alternative mechanisms.",
         "PAH deficiency is caused by loss-of-function (LoF) mutations in the PAH gene. Over 1,000 mutations, mostly missense, but also nonsense, splice site, small insertions/deletions, and larger deletions/duplications, have been identified and functionally validated. The vast majority of affected alleles are detected by sequencing and targeted deletion/duplication analysis—about 95–99% by sequence analysis and 2–3% by deletion/duplication methods. The disease follows an autosomal recessive inheritance pattern; heterozygote carriers are asymptomatic.",
         "The global incidence is approximately 1:23,930 newborns. Regional variation exists: Karachay-Cherkess region of Russia has the highest (1:850); Europe and some Middle Eastern populations show rates of 1:4,000 to 1:10,000; the United States is about 1:25,000; and Japan has a much lower incidence (~1:125,000).",
         "Newborn screening (NBS) uses dried blood spots collected at 24–72 hours to measure Phe and tyrosine levels by tandem mass spectrometry. Elevated blood Phe (>120 μmol/L) and increased Phe:tyrosine ratio (≥3) are suggestive. Confirmatory diagnosis requires plasma amino acid analysis and exclusion of BH4 defects (pterin analysis), followed by molecular genetic testing to detect biallelic pathogenic PAH variants. Rapid follow-up and early initiation of diet are essential to prevent neurological damage.",
         "Disorders causing hyperphenylalaninemia include defects in tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) synthesis or recycling: GCH1 (AR-GTPCH deficiency), PTS (PTPS deficiency), QDPR (DHPR deficiency), PCBD1 (PCD deficiency), and DNAJC12 deficiency. These conditions may have similar or overlapping biochemical and clinical findings (elevated Phe), but can present with additional neurologic or systemic manifestations (e.g., movement disorders, microcephaly, dystonia, parkinsonism) and require different treatments (BH4 and neurotransmitter supplementation).",
         "Lifelong, individualized therapy for those with untreated blood Phe >360 μmol/L consists of (1) a Phe-restricted diet (controlled natural protein intake), supplemented with Phe-free medical foods; (2) pharmacologic therapy in eligible patients—sapropterin dihydrochloride (synthetic BH4 cofactor) to enhance PAH activity (for responders), or pegvaliase (PEGylated phenylalanine ammonia lyase enzyme) for adults with uncontrolled Phe levels; (3) supportive care by a multidisciplinary team; (4) regular surveillance of Phe and nutritional status. Large neutral amino acid (LNAA) supplementation is another option in adolescents and adults. Aspartame-containing products should be avoided.",
         "With early detection (via NBS) and lifelong, well-managed treatment, individuals have essentially normal growth, physical, and neurodevelopmental outcomes. Modest decreases in IQ and some executive or mental health issues may persist, but severe neurologic or intellectual disability is avoided. Early identification and treatment of women of childbearing age prevents maternal PKU syndrome in offspring. Late diagnosis or untreated disease leads to irreversible neurologic injury."

         "Phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) deficiency is an autosomal recessive metabolic disorder caused by biallelic mutations in the PAH gene, leading to impaired conversion of phenylalanine (Phe) to tyrosine. This results in elevated Phe concentrations and toxic brain effects ranging from mild to severe intellectual disability if untreated. The spectrum includes classic phenylketonuria (PKU), less severe variants, and benign hyperphenylalaninemia. Prompt newborn screening allows early dietary and/or pharmacologic intervention, which prevents severe outcomes. PAH deficiency is among the most common inborn errors of metabolism, detected in newborns worldwide, and requires lifelong management. Untreated pregnancies in affected women can result in maternal PKU syndrome, threatening fetal development."

Late-diagnosed individuals may have epileptic seizures, movement disorders, autistic features, and white matter brain abnormalities. Children exposed in utero to high maternal Phe (maternal PKU syndrome) frequently display intellectual disability, microcephaly, congenital heart defects, growth restriction, poor neuropsychiatric outcomes, and other structural malformations."

Still, treated individuals may have a modest reduction in IQ, specific deficits in executive function, attention, and fine motor skills, and increased risks of psychiatric issues such as anxiety or depression. Neurologic symptoms (e.g., hypertonia, tremor, or seizures) may improve or resolve with controlled Phe levels. Bone mineral density is often below average (osteopenia). Vitamin B12 deficiency can develop if dietary adherence lapses."

Mild hyperphenylalaninemia is 360-600 μmol/L. Clinical severity and risk of neurotoxicity correlate with the degree of PAH functional loss; classic PKU presents earliest and most severely, whereas milder forms may require only monitoring. Genotype correlates imperfectly with phenotype but relates to sapropterin responsiveness: milder variants are more likely to respond. Distinct from PAH deficiency are BH4 deficiencies and DNAJC12 deficiency, which cause hyperphenylalaninemia via alternative mechanisms."

The vast majority of affected alleles are detected by sequencing and targeted deletion/duplication analysis—about 95–99% by sequence analysis and 2–3% by deletion/duplication methods.

         "Phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) deficiency, also known as phenylketonuria (PKU) and hyperphenylalaninemia, is an autosomal recessive metabolic disorder resulting from deficient activity of the PAH enzyme. This leads to toxic accumulation of phenylalanine and downstream neurotoxic metabolites and reduced tyrosine. Clinical severity ranges from classic PKU to mild hyperphenylalaninemia, with early treatment preventing severe neurological outcomes. Newborn screening enables early detection via blood phenylalanine measurement. Untreated, the disorder causes irreversible intellectual disability, psychiatric symptoms, and neurologic dysfunction. Lifelong treatment involves dietary phenylalanine restriction and, in some, pharmacologic agents such as sapropterin or pegvaliase. Prognosis is excellent with prompt and continuous treatment, but maternal PKU syndrome risks the offspring of affected women with poorly controlled Phe during pregnancy.",
         "Without treatment, PAH deficiency leads to progressive and irreversible intellectual disability, significant neurobehavioral and psychiatric problems (emotional disturbances, autistic features), severe neurologic manifestations (seizures, movement disorders including tremor, paraplegia, chorea), microcephaly, decreased skin and hair pigmentation, musty body odor, and eczema. While some neurobehavioral and motor symptoms may improve with later intervention, neurocognitive impairments are permanent. In maternal PKU, offspring are at high risk for intellectual disability, congenital heart defects, microcephaly, growth restriction, and other birth defects.",
         "Early and lifelong treatment maintains near-normal neurodevelopment. Treated individuals may have a modest but measurable decrease in IQ, subtle executive and attention deficits, and increased risk for mental health issues such as anxiety and depression compared to unaffected peers. Some may experience neurologic problems (hypertonia, movement disorders, seizures), which frequently improve or resolve with good metabolic control. Bone mineral density is often mildly reduced, and vitamin B12 deficiency may occur, especially if diet is relaxed.",
         "PAH deficiency encompasses a spectrum: classic PKU (untreated Phe >1,000 µmol/L; severe phenotype), variant PKU (intermediate; Phe 600–1,000 µmol/L), mild PKU (360–600 µmol/L), and non-PKU HPA (Phe 120–360 µmol/L; often requires no treatment). Severity is related to residual enzyme activity and genotype. Responsiveness to sapropterin dihydrochloride (BH4) varies by genotype, with those with mild/moderate deficiency more likely to respond. Maternal PKU syndrome is a distinct variant caused by fetal exposure to high maternal Phe.",
         "PAH deficiency is due to loss-of-function variants in both alleles of the PAH gene. Over 1,000 pathogenic and likely pathogenic mutations—missense, nonsense, splicing, small indels, and deletions/duplications—have been identified and validated. Around 97% of disease alleles are detected by full sequencing and MLPA analysis. Inheritance is autosomal recessive.",
         "Worldwide estimated incidence is 1:23,930 newborns. Incidence is higher in Europe and the Middle East (1:4,000–1:10,000), highest in Karachay-Cherkess (Russia, 1:850), about 1:25,000 in the US, and lower in Japan (1:125,000).",
         "Diagnosis in newborn screening uses dried blood spots (24–72 hrs after birth) to measure phenylalanine and tyrosine (MS/MS). An elevated Phe (lab-specific cutoffs, typically >120 µmol/L) and high Phe:tyrosine ratio (≥3) are followed by confirmatory plasma amino acid analysis. Subsequent molecular genetic testing of PAH confirms diagnosis and guides management. Pterin and DHPR analysis may be done to exclude BH4 deficiencies.",
         "Other causes of hyperphenylalaninemia must be excluded, notably tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) deficiencies (GCH1, PTS, QDPR, PCBD1 gene defects) and DNAJC12 deficiency. These can present with variable HPA and overlapping neurologic features but require additional testing (pterin profile, DHPR activity) as management differs. Classical PKU must also be distinguished from benign HPA and other metabolic/neurodevelopmental disorders.",
         "Lifelong phenylalanine-restricted diet is mainstay for all with untreated Phe >360 μmol/L, using special medical foods for protein requirements. Sapropterin dihydrochloride (BH4 analog) can lower Phe in responsive genotypes; trial indicated for all except biallelic null mutations. Pegvaliase (PEGylated phenylalanine ammonia lyase) is an enzyme substitution therapy for adults with classic PKU uncontrolled by diet. Large neutral amino acids (LNAAs) may be adjunctive in adolescents/adults, except during pregnancy. Aspartame should be avoided. Multidisciplinary medical, nutritional, psychological support is essential.",
         "With diagnosis via newborn screening and prompt lifelong treatment, individuals typically achieve normal intellectual and physical development, with only subtle neurocognitive or psychosocial effects. Neurologic and psychiatric manifestations are minimized or prevented. Lifelong management is required to prevent neurotoxicity. Offspring of women with well-controlled Phe during pregnancy have normal development; poorly controlled maternal PKU results in high risk for intellectual disability and birth defects."

         "PAH",
         "Phenylalanine hydroxylase deficiency (PAH deficiency), also known as phenylketonuria (PKU) or hyperphenylalaninemia, is an inborn error of amino acid metabolism caused by loss-of-function variants in PAH. The resulting dysfunction impairs the conversion of phenylalanine to tyrosine, leading to accumulation of phenylalanine and its metabolites, which are neurotoxic. Untreated, PAH deficiency causes developmental delay, seizures, microcephaly, and intellectual disability. Early identification via newborn screening allows for timely dietary and, in some cases, pharmacologic intervention. Treated individuals largely avoid severe impairment, though subtle deficits persist. Maternal PKU syndrome can cause birth defects in offspring of affected mothers with poorly controlled phenylalanine. Management is lifelong and multidisciplinary.",
         "Untreated PAH deficiency presents with severe intellectual disability, irreversible neurocognitive impairment, microcephaly, seizures, movement disorders, autism spectrum features, psychiatric disturbances, decreased skin/hair pigmentation, eczema, and a musty body odor. Neurologic manifestations may include progressive white matter changes, cerebral atrophy, and epilepsy. Maternal PKU syndrome in offspring leads to congenital heart defects, intellectual disability, microcephaly, and other congenital anomalies.",
         "Early and consistent treatment with a Phe-restricted diet substantially prevents severe neurocognitive impairment, but a modest decrease in intellectual functioning and executive function is typical. Subtle deficits in attention, fine motor skills, executive function, anxiety, and depression are more prevalent. Most neurologic problems like hypertonia and seizures resolve or improve with lowered blood Phe. Slightly reduced bone mineral density and risk of vitamin B12 deficiency occur, particularly with imperfect dietary compliance.",
         "PAH deficiency encompasses a spectrum: classic PKU (complete/nearly complete deficiency, Phe > 1000 μmol/L untreated), variant PKU (intermediate Phe elevation), mild hyperphenylalaninemia (Phe 360–600 μmol/L), and non-PKU hyperphenylalaninemia (Phe >120 μmol/L but <360 μmol/L). Clinical severity and residual enzyme activity vary with genotype, affecting responsiveness to BH4 cofactor therapy (sapropterin), with milder forms more likely to respond.",
         "PAH deficiency results from loss-of-function mutations in PAH, inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. Over 1,000 pathogenic/likely pathogenic variants have been identified and validated, mostly missense, nonsense, or small indels, with rare large deletions. Sequence analysis detects 95–99% of pathogenic variants; deletions/duplications ~2–3%. No other disorders are allelic to PAH.",
         "Worldwide incidence is about 1:23,930 births. Prevalence varies by region: 1:25,000 in the US, 1:850 in Karachay-Cherkess (Russia), 1:4,000–1:10,000 in parts of Europe and Middle East, and lower in Asia (1:125,000 in Japan).",
         "Newborn screening (NBS) involves quantifying phenylalanine and tyrosine in dried blood spots (24–72h of age) by tandem mass spectrometry. Elevated phenylalanine (>120 μmol/L), Phe:Tyr ratio ≥3, and exclusion of BH4 defects by pterin analysis are suggestive. Diagnosis is confirmed by plasma amino acid analysis and molecular detection of biallelic PAH pathogenic variants.",
         "Differential diagnosis includes other causes of hyperphenylalaninemia: tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) synthesis or recycling defects (autosomal recessive GTP cyclohydrolase I deficiency, PTPS deficiency, DHPR deficiency, PCBD1 deficiency), and DNAJC12 deficiency. These are distinguished by biochemical pterin and DHPR testing, and genetic analysis.",
         "Lifelong Phe-restricted diet with Phe-free medical foods is standard for all with untreated Phe >360 μmol/L. Some patients benefit from sapropterin dihydrochloride (BH4 cofactor) if responsive, and pegvaliase enzyme substitution is an option for select adults with refractory hyperphenylalaninemia. Large neutral amino acid (LNAA) therapy is used in select adolescents/adults (not pregnant). Avoid aspartame. Multidisciplinary support (dietitian, genetic counselor, psychosocial support) is essential.",
         "With early identification and strict lifelong treatment, most patients develop normally, avoiding severe intellectual disability. Subtle executive and neuropsychological deficits, mild psychiatric disturbances, and lower-than-average bone density may persist. Maternal PKU syndrome is preventable with preconception and prenatal metabolic control. Untreated or late-treated individuals have irreversible intellectual disability and neurologic damage."

      "Gaucher's disease (GD) is a rare, autosomal recessive lysosomal storage disorder caused by a deficiency of the enzyme glucocerebrosidase. It leads to the accumulation of glucocerebrosides in cells, particularly affecting organs such as the spleen, liver, and bones. The disease is often underdiagnosed, especially in developing countries with limited resources.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Key Case Details\n",
      "- **Patient:** 5-year-old boy from Afghanistan\n",
      "- **Clinical Symptoms:** High-grade fever, hepatosplenomegaly (enlarged liver and spleen), chronic anemia, frequent blood transfusions\n",
      "- **Diagnosis:** Confirmed via genetic screening done outside Afghanistan; later supported by biochemical tests and imaging (ultrasound and CT scan)\n",
      "- **Treatment:** Due to the unavailability of enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) within Afghanistan and the patient's high risk of splenic rupture, a surgical splenectomy was performed. Preoperative vaccinations were administered (against pneumococcus, meningococcus, and *H. influenzae*).\n",
      "- **Outcome:** No major complications reported during the 1-year post-surgery follow-up, except for two episodes of post-splenectomy fever.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Clinical and Laboratory Findings\n",
      "- **Imaging (Fig. 4):** CT-scan reveals massive splenomegaly, with the spleen extending to the pelvic cavity.\n",
      "- **Surgery (Fig. 5):** Gross appearance of the greatly enlarged spleen at splenectomy.\n",
      "- **Histopathology (Figs. 6 & 7):** Splenic tissue shows distortion and replacement of normal architecture with Gaucher cells (macrophages engorged with glucocerebroside).\n",
